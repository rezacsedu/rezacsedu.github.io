## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="img/1664312512000.jpg" width="200">

Hello there! I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Fraunhofer FIT and a Postdoctoral Researcher, RWTH Aachen University, Germany. I did my PhD in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen University, Germany under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Stefan Decker, with distinction (Summan Cum Laude)! 

Besides, I received the best paper (NLP) award at a top data science conference. As the recognition, I won the prestigious ICT Young Researcher Award 2020 for my significant contributions to ICT-related research. 

- I'm a technology lover. I love data science, applied machine learning, explainable AI (XAI), and distributed data analytics. 
- I love learning, mentoring, and coding! Oh yeah, I wrote several machine/deep learning & data engineering [books](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Md.+Rezaul+Karim&ref=nb_sb_noss) too.
- I advocate and ecourage reprodcuable research, hence I loving sharing my codes and implementations on GitHub! 
- Opinions are mine, not my employer's!
