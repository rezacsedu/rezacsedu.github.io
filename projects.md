Research projects:
=================
I had been involved in a number of projects, where I was assigned to and played a varietry of roles that ranging from leading tasks and work packages to application development:

- **Leading the Explainable AI (XAI) department**: developing data + knowledge-driven explainable AI solutions using applied machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and semantic web technologies. 
- **Crypto4GraphAI**: Developing privacy-preserving machine/deep learning primitives for cybersecurity and supply chain knowledge graphs.
- **DEMETER**: Developing quality assessment tools for structured & linked data and predictive modelling (e.g., yield prediction and detection of harmful insects, weed, and pest from UAV images) for smart precision farming.
- **NFDI4DataScience**: Data integration and construction of biomedical knowledge graphs and representation learning on knowledge graphs.
- **Personal Health Train**: distributed andn privacy-sensitive analytics on healthcare data.
