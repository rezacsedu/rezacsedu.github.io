## Research projects
I had been involved in a number of projects, where I was assigned to a variety of roles that ranging from leading tasks and work packages to application development:

- **Leading the Explainable AI (XAI) department**: developing data + knowledge-driven explainable AI solutions using applied machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and semantic web technologies. 
- **Crypto4GraphAI**: Developing privacy-preserving machine/deep learning primitives for cybersecurity, anti-money laundering, and supply chain knowledge graphs.
- **DEMETER**: Developing quality assessment tools for structured & linked data, yield prediction, and detection of harmful insects/pest weeds from UAV images for smart precision farming.
- **NFDI4DataScience**: Data integration and construction of large-scale biomedical knowledge graphs and representation learning on knowledge graphs.
- **Personal Health Train**: distributed analytics on healthcare data and developing privacy-preserving analytics solutions covering bioimaging and NLP use cases.
